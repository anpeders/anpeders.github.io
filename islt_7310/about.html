            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Andy Pederson. I live in Lincoln, Nebraska with my wife Courtney. We have three cats and a dog. My hobbies include video games, film, and playing bass guitar. 
                After working as a bookseller and later as an  assistant manager, I started at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities in 2018. I 
                decided I wanted to go back to school shortly after I began working there.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I graduated from Lincoln Southwest High School in 2007. I received my Bachelor of Arts in English 
            from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2012.   I applied to the University of Missouri-Columbia in 2019, 
            then started this Master of Library and Information Science program in spring 2020. I plan on graduating in fall 2022. </p>
            <blockquote>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
                And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</blockquote>

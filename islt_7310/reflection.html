                <h3>Why Library & Information Science</h3>
                <p>I made the decision to go back to school in early 2019 after years of telling myself that I would not go back to school. 
                    I found years in the service industry to be unfulfilling and wanted a career change. I started working at the Center for 
                    Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2018. My first thought was to get a Master’s 
                    Degree in English because that is what I studied as an undergraduate student. After talking to an adviser though, it didn’t 
                    feel right to me. I began investigating other degree options. A Master’s Degree in Library and Information Science was 
                    appealing to me because I was already working in a library. I spoke to some of my colleagues at the library and they all 
                    encouraged me to pursue it. I applied in the summer of 2019, was accepted in the fall, and started in the spring of 2020.</p>
                <h3>Coursework</h3>
                <p>The first two classes I took were Foundations of Library and Information Science and Introduction to Information Technology. 
                    Jumping back into school after 8 years of not being in school was intimidating at first. I had to reacquaint myself with 
                    producing citations, learning management software, and essay writing. I also had to familiarize myself with a whole new 
                    field of study. Luckily, I found all of this to be very enjoyable. It gave me confidence that I had made the right decision. 
                    These first two courses were a great introduction to library and information science. I was proud of the final assignments I 
                    produced for both of these courses. For Foundations of Library and Information Science, I wrote an essay about the ethics 
                    of library neutrality. For Introduction to Information Technology, I submitted a journal about my experiences with learning 
                    Python and a paper about video game archives. My dream job is working in a video game archive, so I found that assignment 
                    particularly rewarding.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 2020, I took Collection and Access Management and Interaction Design. For our final group project in Collection 
                    and Access Management, we had to develop our own collection development policy. This assignment felt the most like I was doing 
                    “real library work” of any course so far. Interaction Design introduced me to new skills like prototyping, wire framing, and 
                    user testing. We developed an interactive prototype of a board game recommendation site for our final project. The process was 
                    very time consuming and challenging. It tested my design skills and ability to collaborate. I was quite satisfied with how the 
                    completed project. The design skills I developed in this course have been invaluable to me at my job.</p>
                <p>I took Organization of Information and Data and Records Management in the spring of 2021. I would say the main theme of this 
                    semester was: metadata! Both of my final assignments were related to metadata: one was about metadata quality and the other 
                    was about metadata in records management. I discovered that metadata is a topic in library and information science that I am 
                    most passionate about. I often work a metadata specialist at my job. I was very excited to share what I was learning about 
                    metadata with her throughout the semester. I intend to continue learning about metadata in the remainder of my coursework. </p>

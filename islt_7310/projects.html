            <h3>Metadata Essay</h3>
            <h4>Goal 1: To ground students in history, values, ethics, and guiding principles of the information professions.</h4>
            <p>During the spring 2021 semester, I took Data and Records Management. This course was taught by Dr. Sarah Buchanan. For the final assignment, we each had to select a topic 
                in records management to explore. I chose metadata. In my paper How Metadata Contextualizes Records: An Overview of Metadata in Electronic Records Management, I explained 
                the five primary types of metadata. I then detailed how metadata is used in records management. At over twenty pages, this was the longest paper I have ever written. 
                The thesis was that metadata provides context to the organizational processes of records management. In the end, I discussed how metadata can replicate institutional biases like racism and sexism. </p>
            <p>This assignment was challenging but very valuable. It taught me how important ethics are in every aspect of our information architecture. The outcome of our professional ethics can manifest in ways that are not always obvious, like in information 
                technology, data, and metadata. It also taught me the importance of ethics in recordkeeping. Records have an ethical, social, and legal dimension that require the vigilance information professionals 
                to preserve.</p>

            <h3>Neutrality Essay</h3>
            <h4>Goal 2: To provide students with the evaluative and analytical skills to respond flexibly and adaptably to future changes and challenges within the organizations and institutions where they will be employed.</h4>
            <p>Hyerim Cho’s course Foundations of Library Science taught me how to think about libraries, library science, and information critically. The course provided a history of libraries, gave an 
            overview of major topics in library science, and explored the ethical dimensions of library science. The critical essay assignment encouraged me to explore an ethical issue in library 
            science. I wrote about the concept of neutrality in libraries. I explored guiding ethical documents in library science like the ALA Bill of Rights. I argued that libraries are inherently not neutral 
            because they reflect the cultural biases of their staff. In the United States, this means that libraries tend towards replicating a Eurocentric worldview with embedded values that are white, 
            colonialist, and patriarchal.</p>
            <p>Applying a critical lens to library ethics allowed me to develop my own sense of professional ethics. This will serve me well in moments of decision making, both big and small, in my professional career. 
                I think that understanding history is critical to adapting to future changes. Learning about history provides an opportunity to reflect 
                on the successes and failures that culminate in the present. History serves as a template for future. Learning that history will help guide decision making and ensure that past failures are not repeated.</p>

            <h4>Goal 3: To provide students with opportunities to develop cutting-edge technological skills and competences used across the information professions.</h4>
            <p>I attended to this goal in the course Introduction to Information Technology in spring 2020. This course was taught by Gail Eubanks. In this course, I learned how to use 
                library technologies and tools like OPACs, online databases, and learning management systems. I completed a semester long “stretch project” that involved me learning the
                 programming language Python. I took the Udemy course Complete Python Bootcamp that taught me how to set up a dev environment and start programming. Thanks to this course, I was able to complete 
                a few simple programs in Python. I also learned how to use the command line and the software Jupyter Notebook. I compiled a journal that detailed my successes, failures, and what I learned by the end.</p>
            <p>I have already been able to apply this knowledge to my job, where I have learned more about programming and development. The confidence I gained from teaching myself 
                Python as part of this course made me more comfortable with learning other new programming languages. 
                After taking this class, I started to work more directly with the dev team in my office. I successfully installed a Bash shell, learned how to operate 
                Unix, and set up our unique dev environment all thanks to the skills I first learned in this course.</p>

                <h3>Website Prototype</h3>
            <h4>Goal 4: To develop an appreciation of the service-based and user-focused nature of the information professions.</h4>
            <p>In Joi Moore’s Interaction Design course, we learned the principles of interaction design and user experience. One critical instrument of interaction design is user testing. My project partner 
                Stacey Spencers and I conducted user testing to improve the design of a website prototype. The wireframe prototype we designed was a reimagining of the ALA Games and Gaming Roundtable. We created 
                this prototype using the collaborative wireframe prototyping tool Figma. Figma allowed us to create a prototype that was interactive. Users could click on 
                buttons, visit different pages, and submit comments. The design choices we incorporated were the result of user testing and user-centric design principles. You can see 
                the front page of our wireframe site below. </p>
            <p>This course emphasized users and user experience in every reading and assignment. This project in particular changed how I view library related technology and websites in general. 
                Now whenever I make design decisions, I first consider who the user is and why they are using what I’m making. It made me reconsider past design decisions I made at work and continues to influence how 
                I think about the change I make to our website at work. Library related technologies in particular should be designed with serving patron needs as the guiding principle.</p>

          <h2>Andy Pederson's Portfolio</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Andy Pedersonâ€™s Program Portfolio website.</p> 
          <p>The goal of this site is to create an online, interactive version of my portfolio for my Master of Library and Information Science degree. 
               A portfolio is required for every student in the program. This site will be used to develop and document my portfolio.
               <p>This portfolio provides an overview of what I have accomplished as a student. The projects I have included on the Projects page represent some of my best work.</p>
              <p>Visit the About pagge for information about my personal life, education, and career. You can learn about the projects in my portfolio on the Projects page. For more information about my experiences
          in this graduate program, visit the Reflection page. If you need to reach me, please visit my Contact page.</p>
